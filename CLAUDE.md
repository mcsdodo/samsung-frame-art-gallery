# **IMPORTANT**  Markdown file naming
When creating new files in _tasks directory, use XX-[FILE_NAME].md format (e.g. 01-TASK.md) for easy sorting. Increment XX as needed.

Tasks, plans, and design documents are ALL stored in the _tasks folder. Do NOT create docs/plans or similar directories.

Root of the application is the root folder.
