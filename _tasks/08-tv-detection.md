Can we somehow detect TVs on local network? Use bonjour or similar protocols to find Samsung TVs. Then have a dropdown in the UI to select which TV to use. In case none found, input an IP address manually (store persistently volume for app restarts). If found, show the model name and IP address in the dropdown. Remember dropdown selection for next app start. If only one TV found, select it automatically.
