https://metmuseum.github.io/ here is some documentation for The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.

# Preparation
1. Read the documentation of the Met Museum Collection API: https://metmuseum.github.io/
2. analyze what's possible with the API, e.g. search for art pieces, get details, get images etc.

# Implementation ideas:
1. split the "Local Images" section into two sections: "Local Images" and "Metropolitan Museum of Art". Could be tabs and must be extensible to add another data source.
2. introduce a search field (based on the API search capabilities) to search for specific art pieces, artists, or art movements.
3. display the results as thumbnails, user can select specific images.
4. upon selection "Upload click" upload to the TV.


# Think about:
1. should we not split the backend and frontend (in general) for faster iterations?
