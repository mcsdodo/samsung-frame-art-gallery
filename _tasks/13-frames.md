many images from the museum have frames around them. these frames need to be removed before displaying the images on the samsung frame TV.

when uploading the image to the TV add an option to crop frame (user can select percentage of image to crop from image). E.g. 10% if an image has 1000x100px will crop the image to 900x90px.

Then apply automatic matte (white) to all images uploaded to the TV to match the 4K resolution ratio. It should be applied after cropping the frame. The width should be always 12% of the longer side and calculated accordingly for the shorter side.
