we alrady have an option to crop the image and to add matte. Let's add an option to crop the image to fit the frame dimensions automatically, without adding matte. let's call this option "Re-framing".

Add a checkbox (before the crop and matte options) labeled "Re-framing". When this option is selected, the image should be resized and cropped to completely fill the frame dimensions, potentially cutting off parts of the image. Basically keeping the aspect ratio of the TV frame, but filling it completely with the image.

When "Re-framing" is selected, disable and matte option. The crop option can be enabled, crop would be applied after re-framing.

Preview button would then show the image processed just how it would appear on the TV.
