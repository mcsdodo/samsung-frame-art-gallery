# Parked ideas for Google Arts and Culture direct integration

Lets imagine we would like to integrate Google Arts and Culture images into our project.

Maybe run it in a iframe, there user would choose browsing mode, e.g. by art movements (`https://artsandculture.google.com/category/art-movement`) or artists (`https://artsandculture.google.com/category/artist`)

Then would choose a specific artist or art movement. We would give him an option to select specific images or just a random slideshow from that category.
